## Fair Use Billing Policy 

We believe you should only have to pay for members that are actively using Stoplight, so we offer a Fair Billing Policy. We go a step beyond traditional Fair Billing Policies and only count a member as active if they have taken a meaninful action inside of Stoplight in the last 30 days. Feel free to invite users to your Stoplight organization, and rest assured that they will not count towards billing until they have found the time to really get started.

### Overview

- You’ll only be charged for members that are active on the day that you upgrade to a paid plan.
- If all members become passive, you will be charged the minimum active member count for your chosen plan, unless you decide to downgrade to the Open Source plan.
- Any changes to the number of active members will be reflected in your monthly statement.

### Active Member

To be considered an active member, you must perform one of the following actions in the last 30 days: 

- Create or update a project
- Create, update, or delete project files

Any members that have not performed one of these actions in the last 30 days are considered passive members. 

### Billing

Every new member starts as a passive member. They will not count as an active member until they login/register and perform their first action.

We’ll keep track of this for you, and bill you at the end of each month. We also automatically detect when members become passive (ie when they have not performed an action in 30 days). When that happens, we will deposit prorated credits to your Stoplight account that will be applied on your next invoice. These credits have no currency or exchange value, are non-transferable and non-refundable, and will expire following the termination of your paid services plan with Stoplight.
