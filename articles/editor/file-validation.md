# File Validation

![](../../assets/gifs/file-validation-oas-spec.gif)

File validation is the process of checking a file's syntax to make sure it meets specific requirements. This validation is used by Stoplight to ensure any file edits are in the correct format prior to being saved. This is especially helpful while editing structured file formats, for example OAS documents, so that any syntax errors can be resolved.

File validation is run after every file edit to make sure no errors were introduced since the last save. A notification will appear if syntax errors were introduced so that they can be resolved before attempting to save again.

If a syntax error is detected, an alert will appear at the bottom of the window and you will automatically be guided to where the error has occurred.
