# Working with Files 

![](../../assets/gifs/fileexplorer.gif)

As part of our effort to make the Stoplight platform more flexible and familiar we added a file explorer to Stoplight Next. You can now see all your files sorted by filetype in one central location within Projects. File types include: 

* .hub (Hub/Docs Files)
* .oas2 (Modeling Files)
* .scenarios (Scenario/Testing FIles)
* .prism (Prism Files) 
* .md (Markdown Files) 

## File Explorer 

Within the file explorer you can:
 
* **Search for Files**
	* Search for files using the **search bar** at the top of the file explorer 
* **Create Files** 
	* Hover to the right of the filetype headers and click the **+** to create a new file 
* **Export Files** 
	* Hover to the right of a file and click the **arrow** to export files into OAS
* **Delete Files** 
	* Hover to the right of a file and click the **trash can** to delete files
