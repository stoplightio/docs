# Publishing 

## What 

Publishing your documentation has never been easier. Stoplight has added: 
- New **Integrations** for Segment, Intercom, and Google Analytics to allow for traffic monitoring and additional analytics 
- New **Authorizations** to make sure your documentation is secure at all times. This includes basic user/password authentication and SSO provider integration, powered by Auth0, SAML, and more.
- New **Builds** section for tracking published Hubs, including when a Hub was published, who published it, and under what domain.
