# Using the CRUD Builder

Stoplight's CRUD builder allows you to easily design and model data structures
used by your API. The CRUD builder is especially useful for:

* Drafting API requests and response bodies under an API endpoint
* Creating [models](./api-models.md) for your API
* Creating [shared responses](./shared-params-responses.md#shared-responses) for
  re-use across multiple endpoints

There are three different methods for generating a CRUD model:

* Using the CRUD builder **editor**, which allows you to create data structures
  in an easy-to-use, graphical format

* Using the **Generate from JSON** feature, which allows you to copy and paste
  an existing JSON document into the CRUD builder to have a model automatically
  generated for you

* Using the **Raw Schema** editor, if you would prefer to modify the data
  structure with raw JSON

While each method can be used individually, you will most likely find yourself
using a combination of all three while drafting API endpoints, models, and
shared responses.

## Using the Editor

<!-- FIXME: Insert GIF of using the editor, creating objects, setting their type, etc -->

We created the CRUD builder editor to make data structure creation as simple as
possible. You can find the CRUD builder editor under the **Editor** tab under
any request, response, or model view.

To start utilizing the editor:

* Click the **+** (plus) icon next to the root **object** to start adding fields
  to the data structure. The plus icon can also be used on nested objects to
  create a hierarchy of arbitrarily-nested data structures.

* Set the **field name** (or _key_) of a data field by clicking the text label
  to the left of the newly-created field. Field names can be composed of any
  alpha-numeric characters, but can only be specified once. You will receive an
  error if you try to re-use field names multiple times on the same level
  (though they can be re-used on nested objects).

* Set the **type** of a field by clicking the _string_ label to the right of
  the field name. The default type for a newly-created field is 'string',
  however other types include:

  * objects (for nesting objects)
  * arrays
  * numbers
  * integers
  * booleans
  * nulls
  * [references](./duplication-refs.md)

  Field types can also include _Combination Types_, which include 'allOf',
  'oneOf', and 'anyOf'. These special types allow for object inheritance from
  other data structures and models, and discussed in more detail
  [here](./object-inheritance.md).

* Optionally, you can set extra validations on the field, for example:

  * **Enumerations** (or _enums_ for short) allow you to restrict the contents
    of the field to be specific values. For example, if you are creating a
    'color' field of type string, you may want to restrict the strings used in
    that field to specific colors (red, blue, green, etc).

  * **Format** allows for validating the field value is of a specific format. A
    few common format validations include: date, time, date-time, URI, and
    email.

  In addition to the validations listed above, there are also per-type
  validations that can be used depending on the type of the field. For example,
  string validations include setting a minimum/maximum length and regex pattern.
  For numbers, you can set minimum/maximum values and even validate that the
  numeric value is a multiple.

* Optionally, you can specify a field as **required**, which ensures that the
  field is present in all requests (and an error is thrown otherwise).

## Generating from JSON

If you have a pre-existing JSON document that you would like to convert to a
Stoplight data structure, the **Generate from JSON** button available towards
the top of the CRUD editor allows you to do just that.

<!-- FIXME: Insert GIF of the generate from json feature -->

To start:

* Click the **Generate from JSON** button, opening a text input

* Either paste or write the contents of the desired JSON object into the text input

* Click the **Generate** button

And that's it! The JSON document will automatically be converted into a
Stoplight data structure, able to be included as models, request/response
bodies, and shared responses.

<!-- theme: info -->

> The result of a **Generate from JSON** can also be edited using the CRUD
> editor once it is generated, so you can still modify and add validations
> afterwards.

## Editing the Raw JSON Schema

<!-- FIXME: Insert GIF of clicking the 'raw schema' button and editing the json -->

While not for the faint hearted, you can also edit the raw JSON schema directly
if you are familiar with the format, or have a pre-existing JSON schema
representation of your data structure.

To edit the raw JSON schema, click the **Raw Schema** tab next to the **Editor**
tab. This will open a text box with the JSON schema of the current object. From
there, you can either edit or copy and paste contents directly into the text box
to update the data structure.
