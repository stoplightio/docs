# OpenAPI Validation

![](../../assets/gifs/file-validation-oas-spec.gif)

OpenAPI validation is the process of verifying the underlying OpenAPI file syntax by making sure it conforms to the [OpenAPI Specification requirements](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#the-openapi-specification) provided by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). Stoplight immediately validates any changes done to a spec to ensure they are in the correct format prior to being saved.

Stoplight currently supports the OpenAPI v2 specification. We are working on support for OpenAPI v3, and should have more information in the coming months.
