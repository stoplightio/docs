# OpenAPI Validation

![](../../assets/gifs/file-validation-oas-spec.gif)

OpenAPI validation is the process of verifying the underlying OpenAPI file syntax by making sure it conforms to the [OpenAPI Specification requirements](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#the-openapi-specification) provided by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). Stoplight immediately validates any changes done to a spec to ensure they are in the correct format prior to being saved.

<!-- theme: info -->
> Stoplight currently supports the OpenAPI v2 specification. We are working on support for OpenAPI v3, and should have more information in the coming months.
