# OpenAPI Validation

![](../../assets/gifs/file-validation-oas-spec.gif)

OpenAPI validation is the process of verifying the underlying OpenAPI file syntax, making sure it conforms to the [OpenAPI Specification requirements](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#the-openapi-specification) provided by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). This type of validation is one of many forms of validation used by Stoplight to ensure any updates are in the correct format prior to being saved.

Stoplight currently supports the OpenAPI v2 specification. We are working on support for OpenAPI v3, and should have more information in the coming months.
