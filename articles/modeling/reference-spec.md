<!-- REFBUILDER GIF/VIDEO-->

## What

Referencing another specification allows for cleaner and more organized code. Some use cases are as follows:

* Generate API documentaion in Hubs
* Deduplicate common structures like responses or shared parameters in Modeling
* Test a connected API specification in Scenarios
* Setup a mock server for an API in Prism

## How

1.  Choose the **source**

    * This File

    * This Project

      * Select a **file**

    * Shared/Common

    * External URL

      * Enter a valid **URL** to an existing specification

2.  Select a **target**, if required

3.  Confirm your choice. (Only required if there is a confirm button)
