## Additional Notes

* The Code Generation tab can but used to view your request in another language so it can be sent through other means.

* If a path or endpoint is selected from your current specification, the tabbed menu will prepopulate with any parameters defined in the spec.

* To add variable path parameters, wrap the parameter name in the path in curly braces like so `/path/{param}` and then fill in the value in the Variables tab.

* To use environment variables in your request, enter `{$$.env.variable_name}` as the value and the populated value can be viewed or changed in the variables tab.
