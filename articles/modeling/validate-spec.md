# Spec Validation

![](../../assets/gifs/file-validation-oas-spec.gif)

Spec validation is the process of verifying the underlying OAS file syntax, making sure it conforms to the [Open API Specification requirements](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification#the-openapi-specification) provided by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/). This spec validation is one of many forms of validation used by Stoplight to ensure any updates are in the correct format prior to being saved.

For more information on why these validations are necessary, please see [File Validations](../editor/file-validations.md).
