# Stoplight v4.2.0 and v4.1.2 Releases
 
## New :rocket:

* Hubs basePath option to prefix all routes
* Hubs Reverse Proxy Support: This feature + the basePath feature make it possible to mount a hub into a route in your existing applications
* Support for importing files into a project [view docs](https://docs.stoplight.io/platform/editor-basics/import-files)

## Enhancements :muscle:

* Published Hubs support embedding basic auth creds in the url, for example `https://username:password@myhub.com`
* Better onboarding experience for new users

## Fixes :wrench:

* Manually re-ordering JSON schema properties in the "Raw" tab
* When creating a “Get” step in a scenario from the Swagger/OAS matrix, the path parameter appeared twice ([#192](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/192))
* When using 'deref=all' parameter in the export URL, OAS specs in the response section were not derefing ([#227](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/227))
* Code generation failing if variable includes a double quote ([#219](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/219))

* Try It Out code generation not working with numeric $$.env variables in headers ([#204](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/204))
* Display model title instead of key in generated documentation sidebar ([#199](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/199))
* Prism instance methods are now an array of strings ([#211](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/211))
* Tags are now sorted by the order they appear in the OAS spec. To change order, go to Code View and rearrange the tags. Any paths that aren’t tagged will be sorted alphabetically within the Reference section ([#214](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/214))
* Users with read only access cannot run Scenarios([#228](https://github.com/stoplightio/desktop/issues/228))

* Inviting users by email where the email capitalization differs from the existing account email
* Selection dropdown being cut off when referencing in a short markdown block
* Edge case freeze when using "length" property in json examples
* JSON schema viewer now supports nesting up to 50 levels deep
